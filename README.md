# responsive-landing
Creating a responsive landing page using HTML, CSS with a little bit of JQuery (based on this tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJXXf3_dcng)

See it [here](https://codyfet.github.io/responsive-landing/index) 

Most interesting points from this tutorial (for me):

* Shortcut for smoth scroll (see in js file).
* Usefull Favicon generator http://tools.dynamicdrive.com/favicon/
* Sample for media query of landscape mode
* Mockup image generating (see video)
